# Demo assets (local)

We keep demo images in `images/` and docs outputs in `docs/`.

- Screenshots: `images/screenshot-*.png`
- Collage: `docs/collage.png`
- Demo GIF: `docs/demo.gif`

## Build locally

Requirements: ImageMagick (`montage`, `convert`).

- Collage
  - scripts/make-collage.sh
- Demo GIF
  - scripts/make-demo-gif.sh [fps]

Tip: Try 4–5 fps for medium speed, 8–10 for fast.
